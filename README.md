# CloudConfiguration

The write once, run anywhere configuration library. Designed to be a platform agnostic way to automatically configure connections to your hosting services.

## Platforms:

- [Bluemix CloudFoundry](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/)

## Supported services:

- [Alert Notification](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-alert-notification/)
- [AppID](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/app-id)
- [Auto Scaling](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/auto-scaling)
- [DB2](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-db2-on-cloud)
- [Cloudant](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db)
- [MongoDB](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/MongoDB/index.html)
- [MySQL](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mysql/)
- [Object Storage](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/object-storage)
- [PostgreSQL](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-postgresql/)
- [Redis](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/redis-cloud)

## Swift version
The latest version of CloudConfiguration works with the `3.1.1` version of the Swift binaries. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).

## Configuration
The latest version of CloudConfiguration relies on the [Configuration](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Configuration) package to load and merge configuration data from multiple sources, such as environment variables or JSON files. It also relies on [Swift-cfenv](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv), which provides structures and methods to parse Cloud Foundry-provided configuration variables, as well as providing default values when running locally.  All of this information is available in an instance of `ConfigurationManager` from CloudConfiguration.


## Usage
To leverage the CloudConfiguration package in your Swift application, you should specify a dependency for it in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
 import PackageDescription

 let package = Package(
     name: "MyAwesomeSwiftProject",

     ...

     dependencies: [
         .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CloudConfiguration.git", majorVersion: 2),

         ...

     ])
 ```

 Once the Package.swift file of your application has been updated accordingly, you can import the `CloudFoundryEnv`, `Configuration`, and `CloudFoundryConfig` modules in your code to access:

```swift
import Configuration
import CloudFoundryEnv
import CloudFoundryConfig

...

let cloudConfigFile = "configFile.json"

let manager = ConfigurationManager().load(.environmentVariables).load(file: cloudConfigFile)

let mongoDBService = try manager.getMongoDBService("MyMongoDB")

mongoDBService.username
mongoDBService.password
mongoDBService.hostname
mongoDBService.port
```

The main purpose of this library is to simplify accessing the configuration values provided by Bluemix services, as this previous example shows with MongoDB.  For a list of the configuration values and accessing method for each service, check out the [docs](docs/Classes) directory, which contains documentation for each method generated by [Jazzy](https://github.com/Realm/jazzy).

## Running your application in Bluemix vs. locally
The functionality provided by this module works locally as well as in Bluemix.  To leverage its functionality locally, simply include a configuration file, like the one leveraged by the [Swift tests](Tests/CloudFoundryConfigTests/config_example.json), with the relevant service credentials.  

When running in Bluemix, binding the desired services to the application and restaging will automatically add the service credentials to the `VCAP_APPLICATION` object, which is ingested by loading the `.environmentVariables` during the `ConfigurationManager` initialization.
